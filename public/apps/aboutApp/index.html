    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>Yes, the Lower Canada College team <em>is</em> centered around the theme of Jurassic Park, but the website team thought simply making a regular website would be quite boaring––not to mention the fact that it could be accompplished using builders like Word Press</p>
    <p>We wanted to make something that would truly fascinare the judges. As we were thinking about the possibilities of the website, we came accross the following scene from teh movie.</p>
    <p>Here, the main character logs into an old-looking computer and secures the entire building. That was the springboard for the entire website.</p>
    <p>Indeed, this website is themed around the Rhapsody operating system, a typical operating system for the time that greatly ressembles the one you saw on screen in the movie.</p>
    <p>This operating system, however, <em>is</em> dissimilar than the one you saw in the movie, which was an operating system called IRIX developed by the Silicon Graphics Co. This operating system is a mockup of the Apple Rhapsody operating system.</p>
    <p>The sole explanation for the discrepancy is that we, the robotics team, found the IRIX operating system relatively boaring for most. On the other hand, most people have used a mac at some point in their lives, and thus, seeing its ancestor may be a more exhilerating experience.</p>
