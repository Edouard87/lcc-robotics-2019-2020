        <h4>You may have noticed, however, that what you see here <em>is not</em> the same as the IRIX workstation in the Original Jurassic Park movie.</h4>
        <p>The reason for this is the answer to the following question: <em>do you have <strong>any</strong> idea what IRIX is?</em></p>
        <h4>The anser is no</h4>
        <p>Even if Silicon Graphics only became defunct in as late as 2009, not many people have <em>any</em> idea what the
        company was, and not many people have ever used the actual operating system. It is thus not very impressive for anyone.
        </p>
        <p>We, on the other hand, wanted to make something that would be <em>impressive</em>, and, well, Silicon Graphics just didn't really achieve that goal.
        Most people, however, have used a Mac before, and have seen the MacOS operating system.</p>
        <h4>This is MacOS Rhapsody</h4>
        <p>At about the same as IRIX was being developped, Apple was also creating an operating system of its own, which greatly ressembled IRIX, called 
            Mac OS X Server 1.0.
        </p>
        <p>Before releasing Mac OS X Server 1.0, however, Apple released unstable versions only meant for developers. These were
          called Rhapsody Developer Release 1 and Rhapsody Developer Release 2, respectively. </p>
        <p>The robotics website is based off of Rhapsody Developer Release 2. Although We have attempted to emulate most
          of its features, it is <em>not</em> indetical</p>
        <p>The following video is a demo of Rhapsody Developer Release 1.</p>
        <h2>Rhapsody</h2>

        <h2>Installing Apps</h2>
        <p>Each app on the operating system represents a website component as per the CRC rulebook. Since this is a new account, there
            is no app currently installed on the system.
        </p>
        <p>Originally, you would have had to use some kind of browser to obtain apps, just as we do today. Here, however, installing apps is done through the App Installer. Open
            the App Installer by pressing on the Tools menu at the top of your screen and clicking App Installer.
        </p>

            <img src="img/app-installer.png">
        </div>
        <p>Then, in the menu that opens, select the app you wish to install and click Install.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Opening Apps</h2>
        <p>Once the app is installed, you can head over to the desktop (keep in mind that the windows can be dragged by grabbing their top) and double-click on the icon.</p>
        <h2>Uninstalling Apps</h2>
        <p>To delete an app, you must simply click on the App Uninstaller under Tools and click Uninstall.</p>
        <h2>Changing the Language</h2>
        <p>To change the language of the operating system, head over to Tools and click on Preferences.</p>
