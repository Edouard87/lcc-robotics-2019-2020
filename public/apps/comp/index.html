        <h1>Competition Description</h1>
        <p> This is my second year on the robotics team, and both years have been so memorable. Being on this team has
          been one of the life changing experiences in my life. It has taught me to use basic tools in a workshop and
          how to make a film. The games that CRC produce every year are so worth the time spent and all the work that we
          put in. The film has been an amazing experience to record and co-direct and to be a part of this team. This
          team has had many memorable moments, it’s had its ups and downs but in the end, we are a team, and that’s
          what’s important.</p>
